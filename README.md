# Project Management System

## Introduction

Welcome to our Project Management System project! This web-based application is designed using the MVC architecture to facilitate efficient management of projects, tasks, and teams. Similar to popular project management tools, our system focuses on enhancing collaboration, tracking progress, and ensuring project delivery within set deadlines.

## Project Details

### Team Composition

- Teams can consist of singles, pairs, thirds, and fours.
- A team of four members will have additional features to develop.

### Project Presentation

- The project presentation will take place on specified dates later in the course.
- All team members must be present during the presentation.
- Each team member will be graded separately for their contribution to the project.

### Submission Deadline

- The project must be submitted by 31/03/2024 on Moodle.
- Only one partner should submit the project, including the names of all team members.

### Important Guidelines

- Development must be in MVC, with the option to use additional web development technologies (subject to approval).
- No copying of any part is allowed; violations will result in a grade of 0 and potential disciplinary action.
- Teams of four will receive extra features to develop.
- Any delays must be requested via email to the lecturer with relevant documents (e.g., medical certificates or military service documents).
